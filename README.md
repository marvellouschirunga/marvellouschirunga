# Marvellous Humphery Chirunga

Hello, GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marvellous, a MuleSoft Integration Specialist and student at Brigham Young University-Idaho interested in Integrations and Digital Transformation. With 2 years of hands-on experience in the MuleSoft ecosystem, Iâ€™ve been bridging gaps, connecting systems, and making data flow seamlessly. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently learning for a Bachelor's in Software Development and also working towards becoming a Salesforce Applications Architect.
- ðŸš€ **Passion:** My love for APIs, integrations, and solving complex puzzles led me to specialize in MuleSoft.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Mission:** I strive to build robust, scalable, and efficient integrations that empower businesses to thrive.
- Ask me about anything MuleSoft!

## Technologies and Tools

- Proficient in:
  - **MuleSoft Anypoint Platform**: My bread and butter! Iâ€™ve worked extensively with MuleSoftâ€™s ESB, API Manager, and CloudHub.
  - **API Design:** Iâ€™m all about RESTful APIs, RAML, and OAS (Swagger).
  - **Integration Patterns:** From point-to-point to event-driven architectures, Iâ€™ve got you covered.
  - **Java:** Because MuleSoft runs on Java, right?
  - **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and GitHub Actionsâ€”I automate like a pro.
  - **Databases:** SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) for data persistence.
  - **Monitoring and Logging:** Splunk, ELK stack, and custom dashboards.
  - **Version Control:** Git (of course!)â€”I commit like a champ.
